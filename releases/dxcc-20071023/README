INSTALL
-------
dxcc is a self contained Perl script and can run without any external files.
It includes the cty.dat file (provided by Jim Reisert, AD1C, web site:
http://country-files.com/), but also checks /usr/local/share/dxcc/cty.dat
and /usr/share/dxcc/cty.dat for possible updates of this file.

A Makefile which installs 'dxcc' to $DESTDIR/bin (by default: /usr/bin) 
is included. At your option, put an up-to-date version of the country-file to
/usr/(local/)share/dxcc/.
